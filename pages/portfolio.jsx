          <p>
            I wanted to learn a meta-framework so I chose Next.js to build my
            portfolio. This site takes advantage of Next.jsâ€™ lazy image loading
            to improve response time and boost SEO. Next.js has other features
            including server side rendering which I hope to make use of in my
            next project. I also took this as an opportunity to improve my
            Tailwind skills to make a site that is visually appealing and fully
            responsive.
